look at data descripitvely

shared a folder on dropbox (Helen- displacement)

book1 has the data

data is a panel of years and municipalities

municipality--> muni identifier
dept_code --> state identifier
population_1993 --> the initial population
victims_UR --> is a flow, the number of murders that happened that year
cum_victims_UR --> is a stock, cumalative number of murders up to that year (moving sum of column victims_UR)

column E is like the independent variable

column G onward measures population displacement (five different measurements of 
displacement (AS, CODHES) since there is measurement error) --> in flow and stock as well

want to try to understand this measurement error

to do:
0. check that the cumulative sums are correct
1. take the last year for each muni and calc correlation between those 5 cumalative measures
2. there will be 17 correlation matrices
3. try to identifier which observations are outliers
4. plot the pairwise scatterplots (1 against 2, 1 against 3) --> do a grid of scatterplots
	*do this year by year, so 17 in total
5. explore the lag between the violence (number of victims) and displacement measures
	*identify where flow of violence is not zero (ie v_t>0) and then is zero for two years after
	*then we see displacement only (repeat that for these 5 measures) in the third period 
6. when we see violence (in the flow), how many years does it take before we see displacement increase? (is it the same period, after 1 year, after 2 years, etc)
	*do this for each of the 5 measures
	*show distribution (ie histogram)
7. x-axis is cumulative violence, y-axis is cumalative displacement per capita (in the period right before new violence occurs)
the following ordered pairs (each is a dot in the scatter plot), we only have a new data point when
the cumulative violence increases
0, 378
6, 679
15, 1131
in the next muni the points are
3,64
6,374
*create 1 figure for each municipality with five lines (one for each displacement measure)

17 years of data
